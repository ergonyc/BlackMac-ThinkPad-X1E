# OpenCore
OSX 10.15+ Catalina... everything working pretty flawlessly.
 (currently 10.15.6 Beta (19F60d)
 
huge inspiration from : https://github.com/1Revenger1/X1-Extreme-OpenCore-Resources

This config boots Catalina, but has untested stability.   Sometimes the config fails to properly load audio /etc  during load.  Oterwise highly stable.

Note:  UsbPorts.kext includes a couple of entries which refer to empty ports, but don't seem to be causing a problem.  A broken SD card got stuck in the SD reader, so that is not configured.
