Slight tweaks / kexts updates


This config boots Catalina, but has untested stability.   Sometimes the config fails to properly load audio /etc  during load.  Oterwise highly stable. (macOS Catalina Version 10.15.6 (Build 19G2531)ÃŸ)

Note:  UsbPorts.kext includes a couple of entries which refer to empty ports, but don't seem to be causing a problem.  A broken SD card got stuck in the SD reader, so that is not configured.

Updated to opencore 6.0
