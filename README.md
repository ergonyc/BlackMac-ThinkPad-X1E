# BlackMac-ThinkPad-X1E

## OpenCore 
OSX 10.15+ Catalina... everything working pretty flawlessly.

## Clover - depricated
Configuration for OSX 10.14+ on Lenovo ThinkPad X1E

currently works for both Mojave (10.14.6) and Catalina
  - either injected from /kext/Other or installed in /L/E
  
I made a couple tweaks and now it *occationally* freezes (HWMonitor maybe causing... haven't dug into the issue)
also rarely the audio, wifi, or bluetooth will fail on boot... catalina seems slightly more likely for this.
